# youtube_node
## What is this shit? 
-It is a youtube scraper to get download links, thumbnails and much more for videos, if you want to make it better, teach me how to apply background music to the video in node (or in C#, or in Java, or in whatever lang you know). The project is immature as usual. 

## How to use it? 
-I bet you already know.

```
cd youtube_node
npm install
node index.js
```
